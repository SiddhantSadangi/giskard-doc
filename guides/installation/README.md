# Installation & upgrade

{% hint style="info" %}
## Requirements

To install Giskard, you need a **Linux** or **macOS** machine with:

* `git (`[`download`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)`)`
*   `docker (`[`download`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)`).` For an easy installation of Docker you can use:&#x20;

    ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
     sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Cloud installation:**

* To install Giskard in **AWS**, please go to __ [installation-in-aws.md](installation-in-aws.md "mention")__
* To install Giskard in **GCP**, please go to&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Run the following commands to install Giskard in your server

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard.git
cd giskard
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have an error because of the rate limit (`toomanyrequests: Rate exceeded`), please re-execute the docker-compose command line once again.
{% endhint %}

Once the docker-compose starts all the modules, you'll be able to open Giskard at [http://localhost:19000/](http://localhost:19000/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since the backend container may take some minutes to load, please wait a bit and refresh the webpage [http://localhost:19000/](http://localhost:19000/)
{% endhint %}

To login, the default credentials are **Login: admin / Password: admin**

You're all set to try Giskard in action. Upload your first model by following the [upload-your-model](../upload-your-model/ "mention") tutorial.

## Upgrade Giskard to the latest version

In order to upgrade Giskard to the latest version, please run the following in your Giskard distribution directory

```shell
git pull
docker-compose down && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
* The browser may keep using an old version of Giskard UI due to caching. If there are issues after running an upgrade try to **hard refresh** Giskard page by pressing\
  `Ctrl + Shift + R` or  `Command + Shift + R`&#x20;
*   If you installed in Giskard additional **Python libraries** or a **new Python version**, you will need to reinstall them. Please refer to

    [#install-a-new-python-version](./#install-a-new-python-version "mention")
